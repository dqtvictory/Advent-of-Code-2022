# Advent of Code 2022

<a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Link</a> to the official AoC

My own solutions to the challenges of AoC this year in Python.

Executing `python XX.py fname` will display the answers to all the parts of day XX's challenge whose input is read from the file named `fname`

Since this is an event where coders compete for earlies correct submission, my original code that produces the answer is not shown in this repo. Instead, variable names and perhaps a few logics are modified and shown for better readability.

And last but not least, the answers are in no way the fastest/most optimal way to solve the challenges. The key to AoC is just early correct submission, that's it.
